Step 1: Install the correct version of python in your system. See the link provided on the assignment webpage.

Step 2: (NOTE: Windows users must use powershell for this.)
	Create a virtual environment using the following steps: 

	- cd into the "code" directory you just downloaded.
	- pip install virtualenv
	- (macOS/Linux only) chmod +x create_venv.sh
	- Run create_venv.sh (macOS/Linux) or create_venv.ps1 (Windows) from the "code" directory.
	- When prompted, enter the path to your python3 executable.

[To find the path type the following to your command line: "which python" or "which python3" (macOS/Linux), "where python" (Windows). 
Example Output: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3.9]

 
Once created, activate using the following: 

	- (macOS/Linux)
		source env747/bin/activate
	- (Windows) 
		path\to\env747\Scripts\Activate.ps1
	
Your environment is ready!

Deactivate using the following:

	- deactivate
